## "Budgeted_automation_Manufacturing.xlsm" 
    ### This is a demonstration of how to use formulas for automation.
    ### I created the formulas. Let me know if you spot a problem.
    ### Enter the variables in the highlighted cells in Column [C10:C95]. The rest will self-update because the results are formula-driven.
    ### Scroll down to see the budgets for 
        * Revenues, 
        * Production, 
        * Material Usage and Purchase, 
        * Labor, 
        * Selling & Administration, 
        * Cash
        * Cost of Goods Manufactured
        * The Budgeted Income Statement
        * The Budgeted Balance Sheet
        * The Statement of Cash Flows is missing. It's on my to-do list.
    ### Excel tip: turn on the camera option hidden in "Options" under "Quick-Access Toolbar." The icon looks like a camera.
    ### Then, use it to take a picture of the financial statements and then place the frame to the left of the variables for the imputs. This will end the need to scroll down to see the effects of any variable change, then back up to make additional modifications.
    ### I have experience with Excel's PowerPivot and PowerQuery for automation, but it's not on display with this workbook.

## "InventoryReconciliation_Automation.xlsm".- 
    ### The EMS module for Inventory and the General Ledger are reconciled with the use of formulas only. 
    ### The formulas and the diagrame are mine (Tab: "Reconcliliation Report"). 
    ### The purpose of this worksheet is to demonstrate how to perform reconciliation between two datasets, and to demonstrate how to automate the process.
    ### In real-world conditions, consider this workbook as partial automation because there will always be anomalies that need additional consideration.
    ### The datasets are samples extracted from the module for Inventory and the module for the General Ledger.
