# My_Excel_Applications
## "AutomatedTabs_on Worksheet. xlsm" - I did NOT create the VBA Code. 

    ### However, I do collect useful VBA. I wish I had started this habit earlier.
    ### This worksheet creates tabs. Press the blue button to see it in action.

    
###"Budgeted_automation_Manufacturing.xlsm" - I wrote every bit of the Excel formulas. 

    ### Enter the variables in the highlighted cells in Column [C10:C95]. The rest will self-update because the results are formula-driven.
    ### Scroll down to see the budgets for 
        * Revenues, 
        * Production, 
        * Material Usage and Purchase, 
        * Labor, 
        * Selling & Administration, 
        * Cash
        * Cost of Goods Manufactured
        * The Budgeted Income Statement
        * The Budgeted Balance Sheet
        * The Statement of Cash Flows is missing. It's on my to-do list.
    ### Excel tip: turn on the camera option in hidden in "Options" under "Quick-Access Toolbar". The icon looks like a camera.
    ### Then use it to take a picture of the financial statements and place the frame to the left of the input variables. This will end the need to scroll down to see the effects of any variable change.

### "InventoryReconciliation_Automation.xlsm".- The formulas are all mine.
